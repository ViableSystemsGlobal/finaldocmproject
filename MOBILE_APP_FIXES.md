### **Solution Applied**
Updated `apps/mobile/src/config/environment.ts`:de

```typescript
// ‚úÖ FIXED
ADMIN_API_URL: 'http://192.168.0.28:3003',
```

## üñºÔ∏è Issue 2: Profile Image Upload RLS Error

### **Error Message**
```
Error uploading profile image: {"error": "Unauthorized", "message": "new row violates row-level security policy", "statusCode": "403"}
```

### **Root Cause**
Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the `storage.objects` table were blocking authenticated user uploads to the `profile-images` bucket.

### **Diagnosis Results**
- ‚úÖ `profile-images` bucket exists and is public
- ‚úÖ Admin client can upload successfully  
- ‚úÖ Anonymous client can list files
- ‚ùå Authenticated users blocked by RLS policies

## üéØ Issue 3: Profile Image Not Showing in UI

### **Error Message**
User reported: "it says updated successfully but I don't see my profile image change in profile and home tabs"

### **Root Cause**
**Field name mismatch** between Profile tab and Home tab:
- **ProfileScreen** was saving image as `user_metadata.profile_image_url`
- **HomeScreen** was looking for `user_metadata.avatar_url`

### **Solution Applied**
Updated ProfileScreen to use consistent field naming:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ FIXED: Use consistent field name
// ProfileScreen now saves as:
avatar_url: publicUrl

// HomeScreen already looks for:
user?.user_metadata?.avatar_url
```

### **Files Modified**
- `apps/mobile/src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` - Updated field names in load and save functions

### **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- Profile images now display consistently across all tabs
- User session refresh ensures immediate UI updates
- Field name consistency between Profile and Home tabs
