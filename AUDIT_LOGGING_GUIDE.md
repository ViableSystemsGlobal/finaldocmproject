# Audit Logging System Guide

## Overview

The Activity Log (Audit Logs) system in your church management system automatically tracks user actions, system events, and data changes for security, compliance, and operational visibility.

## How It Works

### 1. Database Structure

The audit logs are stored in the `audit_logs` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id          UUID        PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id     UUID        REFERENCES auth.users(id),  -- Who performed the action
  action      TEXT        NOT NULL,                    -- What action was performed
  entity      TEXT        NOT NULL,                    -- What type of data was affected
  entity_id   UUID,                                    -- Specific record ID (if applicable)
  old_values  JSONB,                                   -- Previous values (for updates/deletes)
  new_values  JSONB,                                   -- New values (for creates/updates)
  ip_address  INET,                                    -- Client IP address
  user_agent  TEXT,                                    -- Browser/client information
  created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()      -- When the action occurred
);
```

### 2. Automatic Logging

Audit logging is automatically implemented in the following areas:

#### User Management
- âœ… **User Creation**: When new users are created via User Management
- âœ… **User Updates**: When user profiles are modified
- âœ… **User Deletion**: When users are removed from the system

#### Planned Implementation Areas
- ðŸ”„ **Authentication**: Login/logout events
- ðŸ”„ **Member Management**: Member profile changes
- ðŸ”„ **Communication**: Email/SMS campaigns
- ðŸ”„ **Settings Changes**: System configuration updates
- ðŸ”„ **Data Exports**: When data is exported to CSV/other formats

### 3. Audit Logging Utilities

The system includes a comprehensive audit logging utility (`/lib/audit.ts`) with pre-built functions:

```typescript
// User-related logging
await logUserCreate(userId, userData, adminUserId)
await logUserUpdate(userId, oldValues, newValues, adminUserId)
await logUserDelete(userId, userData, adminUserId)

// Authentication logging
await logUserLogin(userId, loginData)
await logUserLogout(userId)

// Communication logging
await logEmailSend(campaignId, emailData, userId)
await logSmsSend(campaignId, smsData, userId)

// System logging
await logSettingsChange(settingType, oldValues, newValues, userId)
await logDataExport(entityType, exportData, userId)
await logDataView(entityType, viewData, userId)

// Generic CRUD logging
await logCrudAction('create', 'member', entityId, oldValues, newValues, userId)
```

### 4. Activity Log Page Features

The Activity Log page (`/settings/audit-logs`) provides:

- **Real-time Activity Feed**: Shows all system activity in chronological order
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by action type, entity, date range, or search terms
- **Detailed Event Views**: Click any event to see complete details including data changes
- **Export Functionality**: Export audit logs to CSV for external analysis
- **Visual Action Icons**: Color-coded icons for different action types
- **User Attribution**: Track which user performed each action

### 5. Action Types Tracked

| Action | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `create` | New records created | User account created |
| `update` | Existing records modified | Member profile updated |
| `delete` | Records removed | User account deleted |
| `login` | User authentication | User logged into system |
| `logout` | User session ended | User logged out |
| `view` | Data accessed/viewed | Member list accessed |
| `export` | Data exported | Member data exported to CSV |
| `send_email` | Email communications | Newsletter sent |
| `send_sms` | SMS communications | Event reminder sent |
| `settings` | System settings changed | Email configuration updated |

### 6. Entity Types Tracked

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `user` | User accounts and authentication |
| `member` | Church member profiles |
| `auth` | Authentication events |
| `communication` | Email/SMS campaigns |
| `system` | System settings and configuration |
| `events` | Church events and activities |
| `groups` | Discipleship groups and ministries |

### 7. Security & Privacy

- **Data Integrity**: All audit logs are immutable once created
- **Access Control**: Only authorized administrators can view audit logs
- **IP Tracking**: Client IP addresses are logged for security analysis
- **User Agent Tracking**: Browser/client information helps identify unauthorized access
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Consider implementing log retention policies for compliance

### 8. Compliance Benefits

The audit logging system helps with:

- **Data Protection Compliance**: Track who accessed personal data and when
- **Security Incident Response**: Investigate unauthorized access or data breaches
- **Change Management**: Monitor system configuration changes
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Understand how staff use the system
- **Operational Insights**: Identify usage patterns and system optimization opportunities

### 9. Implementation Status
