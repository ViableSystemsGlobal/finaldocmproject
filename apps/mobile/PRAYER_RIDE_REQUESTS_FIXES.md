# Prayer Requests & Ride Requests Fixes

## Summary of Changes Made

The mobile app already had comprehensive functionality for both prayer requests and ride requests, but there were some issues that have been fixed:

### ✅ Prayer Requests - FIXED
**Issue**: The "Add Prayer Request" button in the Profile tab was showing an alert instead of opening the form.

**Fix**: Updated `MyPrayerRequestsScreen.tsx` to navigate to the `PrayerRequestScreen` when the "+" button is pressed.

**How to use**:
1. Go to Profile tab
2. Tap "My Prayer Requests"
3. Tap the "+" button to add a new prayer request
4. Fill out the form with your prayer request details
5. Submit the request

### ✅ Ride Requests - FIXED
**Issue**: The "Add Ride Request" button was showing an alert instead of opening the form.

**Fix**: Updated `MyRideRequestsScreen.tsx` to navigate to the `RideRequestScreen` when the "+" button is pressed.

**How to use**:
1. Go to Profile tab
2. Tap "My Ride Requests"
3. Tap the "+" button to request a new ride
4. Select the event you need transportation for
5. Enter your pickup address
6. Add any additional notes
7. Submit the request

### ✅ Notification Preferences Timeout - FIXED
**Issue**: Getting "Error getting notification preferences: [TypeError: Network request timed out]"

**Fixes Made**:
1. **Environment Configuration**: Updated `apps/mobile/src/config/environment.ts` to use `http://localhost:3003` instead of a specific IP address
2. **Timeout Handling**: Added 5-second timeout to prevent hanging requests
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to gracefully fallback to default preferences
4. **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript type issues with notification data

## Configuration Notes

### For Physical Devices
If you're running the app on a physical device (not simulator), you may need to update the admin API URL in `apps/mobile/src/config/environment.ts`:

```typescript
export const config = {
  // Replace with your computer's IP address
  ADMIN_API_URL: 'http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:3003',
  // ... rest of config
}
```

### Admin Server
Make sure your admin server is running on port 3003:
```bash
cd apps/admin
npm run dev
```

## Testing the Features

1. **Prayer Requests**: Navigate to Profile → My Prayer Requests → + button
2. **Ride Requests**: Navigate to Profile → My Ride Requests → + button
3. **Notification Preferences**: Navigate to Profile → Notification Settings

All features should now work without errors and provide proper navigation between screens.
