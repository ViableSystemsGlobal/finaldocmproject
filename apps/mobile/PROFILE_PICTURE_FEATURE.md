# Profile Picture Feature

## ✅ New Feature Added: Change Profile Picture

You can now change your profile picture in the Profile tab! Here's what was implemented:

### 🎯 **How to Use**
1. Go to the **Profile tab**
2. Tap on your **profile picture/avatar** at the top
3. Choose from the options:
   - **Camera**: Take a new photo
   - **Photo Library**: Select from existing photos
   - **Cancel**: Cancel the action
4. Crop the image (1:1 aspect ratio for circular display)
5. The image uploads automatically and updates your profile

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

#### **Image Picker Integration**
- Uses `expo-image-picker` for camera and photo library access
- Supports both camera capture and photo library selection
- Automatic image cropping with 1:1 aspect ratio
- Image quality optimization (0.8)

#### **Supabase Storage Integration**
- ✅ **FIXED**: Updated to use correct `profile-images` bucket (was using `user-uploads`)
- Automatic file naming with user ID and timestamp
- Proper blob conversion from image URI
- Public URL generation for display

#### **User Experience**
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner during upload
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages
- **Permission Requests**: Automatic camera/photo library permissions
- **Success Feedback**: User confirmation when upload completes

### 🐛 **Issue Resolution**

#### **The Problem**
The original implementation had a bucket name mismatch:
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong bucket name
.from('user-uploads')  // This bucket didn't exist

// ✅ Correct bucket name  
.from('profile-images') // This bucket exists and is configured
```

#### **The Solution**
Updated `ProfileScreen.tsx` to use the correct bucket name:

1. **Upload operation**: Changed from `user-uploads` to `profile-images`
2. **Public URL generation**: Updated to use `profile-images` bucket
3. **Bucket verification**: The `profile-images` bucket exists and is public

### 📁 **Storage Structure**
```
profile-images/
├── profile-images/
│   ├── [userId]_[timestamp].jpg
│   ├── [userId]_[timestamp].png
│   └── ...
```

### 🔒 **Security & Permissions**
- Uses authenticated user session for uploads
- Files are stored with user ID for security
- Public bucket allows viewing profile images
- Proper RLS (Row Level Security) configured

### 🎨 **UI Features**
- **Circular Avatar**: Clean 60x60 pixel display
- **Edit Indicator**: Small camera icon overlay
- **Fallback Display**: Shows user initials when no image
- **Smooth Transitions**: Loading states and updates

### 🚀 **Ready to Use**
The profile picture feature is now fully functional and ready for testing in your mobile app!
